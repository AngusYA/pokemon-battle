A web app recreating the classic Pokémon Yellow battle scene

Although I appreciate the new experience Pokémon Go has brought us, I still find myself facinated by the classic Pokémon Yellow. That's why I created this web app to simulate its battle scene. I used the PubSub pattern to achieve decoupling and make it more scalable. I had a lot of fun doing it and am excited to implement more features to it. [Try it out](https://pokemonbattle.angusyeh.com/) and I hope you'll enjot it!
